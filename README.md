## Overview

- **Feature Summary:** Build an online marketplace for listing and selling used bicycles, where the focus is on local neighborhoods and human connections.  I want to be able to create a listing and upload photos, and I want to set a minimum bid or "buy it now" price.

Assistant context:

We'll start by building the core flow for creating and publishing a bicycle listing. This includes uploading photos, setting a minimum bid or 'buy it now' price, and publishing it to a local feed. After you test this prototype, we can expand on user profiles, location filtering, and bid management. Please review and resubmit any backlog items you'd like to prioritize next.

Builder Round Tasks:
- Implement listing creation form with title, description, price fields, and local area inputs
- Enable photo upload and preview within the listing creation flow
- Display published listings on a simple local feed showing title, price, and main photo
